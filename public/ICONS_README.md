# PWA Icons Required

For the app to be fully installable as a PWA, you need to add two icon files:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

## Quick Solution

You can:
1. Use the icon-generator.html file in this directory (open it in a browser and download the generated icons)
2. Create your own icons using any image editor
3. Use an online PWA icon generator

Place both files in the `/public` directory.

## Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG
- Sizes: 192x192 and 512x512 pixels
- Purpose: Should be square, maskable icons work best
- Design: Should represent your app (can use "T" for Trineo or your logo)

The app will work without these icons, but they're required for a proper PWA installation experience.
